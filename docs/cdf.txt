CDF 1.0

The main type in the libCDF is an object.
The single object can contain value of any type and unlimited amount of sub-objects.

When pushing any data in the object, everything is copied (not referenced).

cdf object structure:
    1)Length, 4 bytes
    2)Type,   4 bytes
    3)NameID, 4 bytes        (NameID`s count starts from 1, as 0 is reserved for an error value)
    4)Data,   <Length> bytes

cdf file structure:
    1)Format signature "CDF", 4 bytes
    2)Version info,           4 bytes
    3)CDF ClassID,            2 bytes (User-defined "class id", isn`t used in the library directly)
    4)Compression info,       5 bytes

    5)NameTable length,       4 bytes (The amount of names)
    6)NameTable                       (<NT length> null-terminated strings, written one after one, including the '\0' byte at the end of each string)

    7)Root cdf_object

Compiler options:
    -D CDF_USE_ZLIB
        Enable file compression support.

    -D CDF_NAMETABLE_NOCOPY
        Disable strdup() calls when appending names to the nametable. 
        Can be extremely tricky and dangerous, use very carefully.

    -D CDF_SAFE_CHECK
        Enable safe-checks in almost every function. Meant to be used during debugging.
